## üß± Low-Level Design (LLD) and OOPS

### OOPS Principles:
- **SRP**: Service files for search, ranking, autocomplete
- **Open/Closed**: Easily switch ranking strategies
- **Dependency Injection**: Inject DB/cache instances into services
- **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces for caching, ranking
- **Liskov Substitution**: Different rankers implement same interface

### Design Patterns:
- Factory: Ranker instance creation
- Strategy: Ranking algorithms (TF-IDF, SQL)
- Singleton: DB/Redis connections
- Adapter: Wrap Redis/Postgres clients

---

## üß© Networking Concepts

- REST APIs: Clean and stateless endpoints
- HTTP methods: GET, POST
- Status codes: 200, 400, 404, 500
- Rate limiting: Prevent abuse using IP-based throttling
- Latency optimization: Redis caching for repeated queries

---

## üóÑÔ∏è DBMS Concepts

- Normalization: Separate `documents`, `tags`, `users`
- Indexes: Full-text index on `tsvector`
- Joins: Retrieve documents with tag/user info
- Transactions: Safe batched inserts
- ACID compliance: Ensured via PostgreSQL
- Query optimization: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to tune performance

---

## üß± High-Level System Design (HLD)

### Local Development Architecture:
```

                            ‚Üí PostgreSQL Search DB
```

### Cloud-Ready Architecture for 100k+ users:
```
[Browser: React + TS + Vite + CDN (Vercel)]
        ‚Üì
[API Gateway ‚Üí Node.js + Express + Docker]
        ‚Üì          ‚Üì
     Redis      PostgreSQL (Supabase)
```

### Components:
- Load Balancer
- Stateless Express APIs
- Redis for hot path queries
- PostgreSQL for full-text and semantic search

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Workflow

1. Topic generator selects new search keywords (e.g., "cars", "dogs")
2. Search engine crawler fetches URLs using search engine result pages
3. Web scraper extracts relevant title and content
4. Extracted data is cleaned and saved in PostgreSQL with FTS index
5. User types query in React UI
6. Autocomplete API returns prefix suggestions
7. User submits search
8. Search API checks Redis:
   - If HIT ‚Üí return cached results
   - If MISS ‚Üí run PostgreSQL FTS or vector search
9. Rank and return top results
10. Cache result in Redis
